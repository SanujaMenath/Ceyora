      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="small-caps">Ceyora</span> was founded with a passion for preserving and
        sharing the rich cultural traditions of Sri Lanka. For over three
        generations, our family has been dedicated to supporting local artisans
        and craftspeople who create these magnificent pieces using techniques
        passed down through centuries. Each item in our collection tells a story
        of Sri Lankan heritage, from the intricate patterns of our handwoven
        textiles to the spiritual significance of our traditional masks. We work
        directly with skilled artisans across the island, ensuring fair trade
        practices and helping to sustain these ancient crafts for future
        generations. Our mission is to bring the beauty and cultural richness of
        Sri Lanka to the world, while supporting the communities that create
        these extraordinary works of art.
